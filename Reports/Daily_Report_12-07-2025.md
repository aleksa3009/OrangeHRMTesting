# Daily Report – 12-07-2025 (Day 1)

---

## Activities:
- Created project repository `OrangeHRMTesting` on GitHub with full folder structure:
  
```
OrangeHRMTesting/
├── TestPlan/
├── TestCases/
├── TestData/
├── ExecutionResults/
└── Reports/
```

- Drafted and committed **Test Plan** (`TestPlan/OrangeHRM_Test_Plan.md`) covering scope, objectives, modules, roles, environment, tools, risks, and 6-day schedule.
- Created initial **Test Data** file (`TestData/employees.csv`) with 20 realistic employee records and linked profile pictures in `/TestData/profile_pics/`.
- Prepared 20 for profile uploads.
- Drafted first 12 test cases for Admin and PIM modules in progress (to be finalized on Day 2).
- Prepared **Daily Report** template in `Reports/Daily_Report_12-07-2025.md`.

## Environment:
- **OS:** Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  
- **Browsers:** Chrome (latest) & Firefox (latest) on desktop only  
- **Tools:** VS Code, LibreOffice Calc (for CSV), Lightshot, Git/GitHub, Markdown (for test case management)

---

## Issues:
- No major blockers; profile pictures needed minor resizing to ensure uniformity in uploads.
- Reminder to verify employee CSV encoding and delimiters for smooth bulk import testing.

4. **Review & Validate:** Check test coverage and prepare for execution phase.
5. **Daily Report:** Compile Day 2 results in `Reports/Daily_Report_13-07-2025.md`.
